        <p class = "pjm-intro">The following map represents the process by which a solar project may apply for interconnection 
            through PJM. This process takes the form of a Cycle – the period of time between the start of an Application Phase and the 
            conclusion of the corresponding Final Agreement Negotiation Phase. Each Cycle consists of the: Application Phase, Phase I,
            Decision Point I, Phase II, Decision Point II, Phase III, Decision Point III, and the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase. 
            Within each of these phases, interconnection studies are performed to ensure the project meets the requirements necessary to 
            interconnect to PJM. However, depending on PJM requirements and developers’ choices, interconnection requests may be subject 
            to differing processes. The points at which the interconnection request may be withdrawn from the interconnection process or
            accelerated to the final agreement stage are displayed in this map. This map also represents the complexity of these studies, 
            the costs associated, and relative timing. According to PJM, the entire process from the Application Deadline through the 
            conclusion of the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase takes approximately 690 days. Note that applications must be created and 
            models built prior to this Application Deadline, so in reality the process takes over 690 days.
