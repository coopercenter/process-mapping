                <br>
                  In 2020, Virginia passed laws to create community solar programs, aimed at expanding access to
                  clean energy options for residents of Virginia. Without needing to install solar options
                  themselves, many community members now have the opportunity to access solar energy. The
                  “shared solar” program has two parts – the Shared Solar Program and the Multi-Family Shared
                  Solar Program. Per the <a href = "https://energy.virginia.gov/renewableenergy/SS_CS.html">Virginia Department of Energy</a>, “the Shared Solar Program [provides] customers of Dominion Energy
                  Virginia the opportunity to participate in offsite, or front-of-meter (virtual) shared solar projects,
                  while the Multi-Family Shared Solar Program provides eligible multi-family customers of
                  Dominion Energy and Kentucky Utilities (Old Dominion Power) the opportunity to participate in
                  onsite, or behind-the-meter solar projects.” Appalachian Power is in the process of joining the
                  Shared Solar Program. Many electric cooperatives are also offering community solar programs,
                  though structured and regulated apart from “shared solar.”

                                The Shared Solar Program allows customers of Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian

                                pay a minimum bill to cover the costs of the infrastructure and distribution services, and then 
                                receive a credit on their monthly electric bill proportional to the output of the shared solar facility

                Agricultural generators fall into two categories:

                to determine if your projecet qualifies as either, consult the Code of Virginia. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Small agricultural generators are customers who operate a small agricultural generating facility that generates renewable energy designed to remain on the utility's distribution system. These facilities must have a capacity of no more than 1.5 MW. Small agricultural generators are subject to the same local, state, and federal permitting process as other projects. For interconnection requests, small agricultural generators must follow the State interconnection process and register as a 
                <a href = "https://www.ferc.gov/qf" target = "_blank">qualifying small power production facility</a>
                pursuant to PURPA. If the project is less than 1 MW, the customer may self-certify to be a qualifying facility instead of going through PURPA. Small agricultural generators may interconnect to electric cooperatives.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Eligible agricultural customer-generators generate energy primarily to provide energy to metered accounts of the agricultural business. Such customer-generators may not have an aggregate generation capacity of more than 500 kW. Eligible agricultural customer-generators are subject to the same local, state, and federal permitting process as other projects. For interconnection requests, eligible agricultural customer-generators must be “interconnected and operated in parallel with an electric company’s transmission and distribution facilities.” Eligible agricultural customer-generators are not permitted to interconnect to electric cooperatives.

                "Brownfield" means real property; the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.
              
                <br>
                2. Submit a letter to the DEQ Land/Brownfields Program documenting why the site meets the criteria as a previously disturbed area; i.e., historically used as a heavy industrial site, RCRA Corrective Action site, etc." DEQ strongly recommends that the developer conducts a Phase I ESA on the brownfield site as part of their due diligence process and incorporates the findings into the letter. Upon receipt of the letter, the DEQ Land/Brownfields Program staff will review the documentation and send a letter to the applicant indicating whether or not the site meets the criteria.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Once the applicant obtains a Brownfield determination letter, they will need to submit the letter to DEQ along with a NOI providing project details and a local governing body certification form certifying that the project complies with all applicable land use ordinances.

                  The Virginia Solar Permit Map is a central source of information for the solar permitting process in Virginia. The website is organized with a landing page to help the user determine which state permits are available for their project and detailed pages for each respective solar permit process and the interconnection process. 
                  <b>For details on any step of any process, click on the respective box for further information.</b> Upon determining which state permit options are available, the user should click on the permit name to be taken to the associated permit page. Permit-specific pages provide details of the entire permit process: Federal, 
                  state, and local requirements, and the interconnection map.
