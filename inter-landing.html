                This tool is intended to provide clarity on which interconnection pathway is required for a
                particular solar project.                
                <br><br>
                Interconnection in Virginia is governed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
                (NERC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) interconnection procedures. Under
                these regulations, the interconnection application process must follow one of two paths: PJM
                or SCC interconnection rules. The pathway required is on a case-by-case basis, depending on
                numerous factors and regulations.
                <br><br>
                The two main determinants are:
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>The ownership of the facility to which the project wishes to interconnect</li>
                <li>The proposed project’s voltage</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>PJM</b></p>
            <p>If the transmission facility to which the project wishes to interconnect is owned by PJM or required to be operated by PJM, then the developer must go through the PJM process. At a certain voltage, utilities are unable to handle transmission and sub-transmission power and must turn the interconnection process over to PJM. PJM only operates transmission and sub transmission lines that a member facility or utility has turned over to the PJM process. Through this handover, PJM becomes in charge of the interconnection process; developers must receive interconnection approval through the PJM process. Utility thresholds for turning the process over to PJM differ based on the utility, with 69kV often used as a basis. However, distribution cooperatives can own up to 138kV facilities and maintain ownership. Project developers should inquire with the utility in their region about the threshold used.</p>
            <p><b>Utility-owned, SCC</b></p>
            <p>If the project is owned by a utility and the utility maintains control of the interconnection process at the elected voltage, the project should apply for interconnection through the SCC process.</p>
            <p>If the transmission facility to which the project wishes to interconnect is owned by PJM or required to be operated by PJM, then the developer must go through the PJM process.

Utility thresholds for turning the process over to PJM differ based on the utility, with 69kV often used as a basis.

                <a href = "https://energy.virginia.gov/public/documents/Public%20Meetings/HB%201925%20Handbook_FINAL%20w%20Comments.pdf" target="_blank">Virginia Department of Energy</a>
                , “if the line is owned by AEP (Appalachian Power), First Energy (Potomac), or VEPCO (Dominion) and it is 69kV or above, it will likely go through the PJM process. If the line is owned by a municipality or an electric cooperative, regardless of voltage, the interconnection will likely be studied through the SCC process.” Project developers should inquire with the utility in their region about the threshold used.</p>
            <p><b>Notes</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The timing of each interconnection study in the overall permit application process varies between projects. Generally, developers look to have completed at least one interconnection study, or even have finished all interconnection studies, before beginning local/state permitting. This is due to the large cost and uncertainty of the interconnection process.</li>
                <li>In March 2024, NERC proposed a ruling in which projects that “have or contribute to an aggregate nameplate capacity of greater than or equal to 20 MVA” and are connected to at least 60 kV will need to register with NERC and be subject to forthcoming restrictions. Check NERC resources for updates to this proposal.</li>
