## Getting Started
### Github
Any changes made to the master branch are automatically pushed into the live server on Azure. Make sure changes are as intended before pushing to the master branch. Commit changes to branches other than master branch then merge when appropriate. Make sure you commit changes frequently to save changes to GitHub.

### Azure
SolTax are hosted on Azure which is a cloud computing platform run by Microsoft. When commit changes are pushed onto the master branch, it is deployed directly to Azure. For Azure login information, contact Mary Beth Wetherell at [meh4q@virginia.edu](mailto:meh4q@virginia.edu).
