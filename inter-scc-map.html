                        The utility has provided the IC with the SGIA, marking the conclusion of the interconnection application process. This step can be reached through one of two paths: <br>
                        1. Per <a href = "https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title20/agency5/chapter314/section70/">20VAC5-314-70 C.11</a> of the Virginia Administrative Code, if the feasibility study shows no potential for adverse system impacts, then the utility will provide the IC with either an SGIA (Schedule 10 of 20VAC5-314-170) or a Facilities Study Agreement within 10 business days of the completion of the study. 
                        <br>
                        2. If the IC must instead go through subsequent studies after completion of the feasibility study process, receipt of the SGIA occurs after completion of the construction planning meeting. Then, per <a href = "https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title20/agency5/chapter314/section70/">20VAC5-314-70 G</a> of the Virginia Administrative Code:
                        "No later than 10 business days after the construction planning meeting, the utility shall provide the IC an executable SGIA as set forth in 20VAC5-314-50 F (Schedule 10 of 20VAC5-314-170)."
