        <p class = "pjm-intro">The following map represents the process by which a solar project may apply for interconnection 
            through PJM. This process takes the form of a Cycle – the period of time between the start of an Application Phase and the 
            conclusion of the corresponding Final Agreement Negotiation Phase. Each Cycle consists of the: Application Phase, Phase I,
            Decision Point I, Phase II, Decision Point II, Phase III, Decision Point III, and the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase. 
            Within each of these phases, interconnection studies are performed to ensure the project meets the requirements necessary to 
            interconnect to PJM. However, depending on PJM requirements and developers’ choices, interconnection requests may be subject 
            to differing processes. The points at which the interconnection request may be withdrawn from the interconnection process or
            accelerated to the final agreement stage are displayed in this map. This map also represents the complexity of these studies, 
            the costs associated, and relative timing. According to PJM, the entire process from the Application Deadline through the 
            conclusion of the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase takes approximately 690 days. Note that applications must be created and 
            models built prior to this Application Deadline, so in reality the process takes over 690 days.

                        The steps in PJM Manual 14H are updated as of July 26, 2023. See <a href = "https://www.pjm.com/-/media/documents/manuals/m14h.ashx">PJM Manual 14H Section 1.2</a> to determine which customer classification fits your proposed project. The two customer classifications for which the process will be outlined are the most common customer designations: Generation Project Developer and the Eligible Customer.
                        <br><br>
                        Per <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/documents/manuals/m14h.ashx">PJM Manual 14H</a> the Application Phase is the “Cycle period that includes both the submission and review of New Service Requests. The Project Developer or Eligible Customer submits an Application and PJM reviews and validates the submission and assigns a Project Identifier” (Page 28). Requirements of the Application phase can be found in Section 2 of PJM Manual 14H. Complete procedures are provided in Tariff, Part VII, Subpart C and Tariff, Part VIII, Subparts A and B.
                        <br><br>
                        Timeline: The Application Phase lasts approximately 90 days from the date of the Application Deadline. The time needed for the collection of required information and completion of the application occurs prior to Day 0 of this timeline.
                        <br><br>
                        NOTE: If instead the New Service Request meets one of the two criteria below per <a href = "https://www.pjm.com/~/media/documents/manuals/m14a.ashx">PJM Manual 14A</a> follow the process outlined in PJM Manual 14A and <a href = "https://agreements.pjm.com/oatt/4090">PJM Tariff Part IV, Subpart A, Section 36</a>. <br>
                        1. “Any New Service Request received prior to April 1, 2018.”
                        <br>
                        2. “Any New Service Request for which, as of the Transition Date (defined in Tariff, Part VII), the Interconnection Customer has received for execution an Interconnection Service Agreement or wholesale market participation agreement or has directed the PJM to file an Interconnection Service Agreement or wholesale market participation agreement unexecuted.”

                        Timeline: the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase runs concurrently with Decision Point III. The Final Agreement Negotiation Phase lasts approximately 60 days from the start of the phase on the first Business Day immediately following the end of Phase III. PJM may extend this phase beyond 60 days. 
                        <br><br>
                        This negotiation happens as follows. "Prior to the start of the Final Agreement and Negotiation Phase, PJM will provide an electronic draft interconnection related agreement from Tariff, Part IX (as applicable to the Project Developer’s or Eligible Customer’s New Service Request) to the parties to the interconnection related agreement. Upon receipt of the draft agreements, Project Developer or Eligible Customer, and Transmission Owner, as applicable, will have 20 Business Days to return written comments on the draft agreements. PJM will have then 10 Business Days to respond and provide revised drafts of the agreements in electronic form, if appropriate."
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                        GIAs typically include the following standard project milestones:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Compliance with pre-GIA milestones</li>

                        <p>
                        Additional milestones can be added to the GIA to accommodate the needs of all involved parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The GIA specifies the rights granted to the Project Developer under the agreement. These rights may include capacity interconnection rights, interim capacity interconnection rights, and injection/withdrawal rights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The standard terms and conditions of construction are included in the GIA. The terms and conditions address the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Project scope</li>
