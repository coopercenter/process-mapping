              <h3>Introduction to Virginia Solar Permit Map</h3>

              <p><br>The Virginia Solar Permitting Map aims to document and bring transparency to the various permitting processes involved in solar facility siting in the hopes of providing a central source of truth that can be referred to when process questions arise, or changes are considered. By illustrating how the various review processes relate to one another and where public engagement may take place, inefficiencies and opportunities to streamline the process may be observed and brought forth. 
                <br><br> The project was funded through a <a href="https://4-va.org">4-VA</a> collaborative research grant issued to Virginia Tech with University of Virginiaâ€™s Weldon Cooper Center as a collaborating university. Research was led by Dr. Ron Meyers and the interactive permit map was developed by the UVA team of Elizabeth Marshall, Katie Treene, Jaden Wang, and Leila Lucy Williams.
